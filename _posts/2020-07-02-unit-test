# Motivation
Recently I am writing unit test for my production codes of ML algorithms, which raises my awareness of the significance of software testing. <br />
I was asked to do the same thing some 3 years ago; but until now I got my hands dirty and found testing is quite a significant part of the software/algorithm development circle.<br />
So I decided to record some of my learnings 3 years later.


# The task  
To test the functionality of each class, method, or module.  
The tester determines all legal (valid and invalid) AND illegal inputs and verifies the outputs against the expected outcomes

# Concepts and Methods
## White Box Testing
 * testing based on an analysis of the internal structure of the component or system.
 * the internal structure/design/implementation of the item being tested is known to the tester
 * the tester chooses inputs to exercise paths through the code and determines the appropriate outputs
The key being, the software program, in the eyes of the tester, is like a white/transparent box; inside which one clearly sees.

## Methods
Design the procedure to derive and/or select test cases based on an analysis of the internal structure of a component or system.
